      <article id="familyArticle">This is Pat. Pat has a lovely family that he sees for maybe 4 weeks out of the year because he's a very busy man. Most of the time he's halfway across the world trying to find a staff that will work 4 days before quitting. He's stressed out and has hardly any time for his wife and two beautiful children. Poor Pat.</article>

      <article id="shirtArticle">If you can believe it, Pat hasn't been able to sell a single shirt yet. I'm trying to hide this picture in the page because it actually hurts my eyes to look at it.</article>

      <article id="frostedCookieArticle">This is the quality of work you get when you buy one of Pat's cookies. On a scale of 1 to 10, most people rate these cookies a solid 3...maybe 4-ish. On average, it takes about 2 minutes to put frosting on each of these cookies. That's 1 minute and 45 seconds longer than most people eat these things before they decide to throw it away.</article>
